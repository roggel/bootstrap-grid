#bootstrap-grid

The scss version of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), responsive grid only.

##How to use
The only file included in this repository is the _bootstrapGrid.scss file. Just import that file into your main sass document, like so:

`@import 'bootstrapGrid.scss';`

In your html you can now use classes like `.container` for the big wrapper, `.row` for every row of columns, and `.col-md-6`, `.col-sm-8`, etc for your responsive columns.

For detailed information on the inner workings of the grid, check out the [Bootstrap Grid system documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid).
